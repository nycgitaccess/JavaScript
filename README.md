Week 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Declare a variable x and initialize it with an integer.

How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest whole number?

Create a array called colors with the strings red, green and blue inside.

How can you find the length of the object you just created?

Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type. For example:

let x = 9; let y = 'Hello';

if () { console.log('SAME TYPE'); }

If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the new value of x?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Create a function that takes 3 arguments and returns the sum of the three arguments.

Create a function named colorCar that receives a color, and prints out, "a red car" for example. (Hint: put it in your file and run it like before.)

Create a function named vehicleType that receives a color, and a code, 1 for car, 2 for motorbike. And prints "a blue motorbike" for example when called as vehicleType("blue", 2)

Can you write the following without the if statement, but with just as a single line with console.log(...);?

if (3 === 3) {
    console.log("true")
} else {
    console.log("false")
}
Create a function called vehicle, like before, but takes another parameter called age, so that

vehicle("blue", 1, 2) prints "a blue used car".
vehicle("blue", 1, 1) prints "a blue new car".
Make a list of vehicles, you can add "motorbike", "caravan", "bike", or more.

How do you get the third element from that list?

Change the function vehicle to use the list of question 6. So that vehicle("green", 3, 1) prints "a green new caravan".

Use the list of vehicles to write an advertisement. So that it prints something like: "Amazing Joe's Garage, we service cars, motorbikes, caravans and bikes.". (Hint: use a for loop.)

What if you add one more vehicle to the list, can you have that added to the advertisement without changing the code for question 9?

Write some code to test two arrays for equality using == and ===. Test the following:

    var x = [1,2,3];
    var y = [1,2,3];
    var z = y;
What do you think will happen with x == y, x === y and z == y and z == x? Prove it!

Don't cheat! Seriously - try it first.

What does the following code return? (And why?)
let bar = 42; 
typeof typeof bar;
